# Shrink to UVP

## Template

```
There is not template for this
``

## Guidelines

Just use the basic template; and instead of adding everything you can, just remove everything you can.

What is absolutely necessary, whithout which one cannot understand?
What is more or less obvious than can be removed?

## Example

Story to shrink:
```
DID YOU KNOW THAT most product people, like product owner, marketing persons, sales people, founders, C*O
fail to generate compelling and crisp stories?
WELL WE PROVIDE the Basic template of the TopSol Playbook, the target-problem-solution articulation
```

Shrinked:
* product people (not even "most product people")
* story telling

Unique value proposition:
```
Story telling for product people
```
