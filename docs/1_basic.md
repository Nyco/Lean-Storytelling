# Basic template

Use these three very simple steps

1. Target
2. Problem
3. Solution

## Template

```
DID YOU KNOW THAT <target>
HAVE <problem>?
WELL WE HAVE/PROVIDE <solution>
```

## Target

This is the people or entities that you target.

## Problem

This is the problem or pain or issue, that they suffer from, and for which it is worth designing a solution.

## Solution

Your solution to your target's problem.

## Example

1. Target: product people, like product owner, marketing persons, sales people, founders, C*O
1. Problem: they fail to generate compelling and crisp stories
1. Solution: use the Basic template of the TopSol Playbook

Template:
```
DID YOU KNOW THAT <target>
HAVE <problem>?
WELL WE HAVE/PROVIDE <solution>
```

Story:

DID YOU KNOW THAT most product people, like product owner, marketing persons, sales people, founders, C*O
fail to generate compelling and crisp stories?
WELL WE PROVIDE the Basic template of the TopSol Playbook
```
