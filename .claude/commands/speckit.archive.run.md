<!-- Extension: archive -->
<!-- Config: .specify/extensions/archive/ -->
Act as the **Chief Software Architect** and **Documentation Maintainer**.
A feature has been merged into the `main` branch. Your goal is to **archive** the feature specification into the main project memory — ensuring completeness, resolving conflicts, closing gaps, and respecting the project constitution.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

### Input Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as follows:
- **First token**: feature spec directory path (e.g., `specs/007-invoice-settings`)
- **Remaining tokens**: scope modifiers (optional, space-separated)

**Supported scope modifiers** (if none provided, update all artifacts):
- `--spec-only` — update only `.specify/memory/spec.md`
- `--plan-only` — update only `.specify/memory/plan.md`
- `--changelog-only` — update only `.specify/memory/changelog.md`
- `--agent-only` — update only the agent knowledge file (GEMINI.md / AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md)

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, output `ERROR: No feature spec directory provided. Usage: /speckit.archive.run specs/###-feature-name [--scope-modifier]` and stop.

---

## Step 0: Setup & Validation (Gate)

### 0.1 Resolve Paths

Run `{SCRIPT}` to identify the active feature directory and its artifacts. This script is mandatory for path discovery. If the script is missing, stop and inform the user.

Derive absolute paths for:
- `REPO_ROOT` (from `{SCRIPT}` output)
- `FEATURE_DIR` (from `{SCRIPT}` output)
- `MEMORY_DIR` (`REPO_ROOT / .specify/memory`)
- `TEMPLATES_DIR` (`REPO_ROOT / .specify/templates`)

**Path convention**: Feature specs live in `specs/{###-feature-name}/` at repo root. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

### 0.2 Validate Feature Directory

Verify `FEATURE_DIR` exists and contains:
- `spec.md` (required)
- `plan.md` (required)

If any required file is missing:
> ⚠️ Invalid feature spec: Missing required files in `FEATURE_DIR`. Expected:
> - spec.md
> - plan.md
>
> Run `/speckit.specify` and `/speckit.plan` first.

**Then stop. Do not modify any files.**

### 0.3 Inventory Optional Artifacts

Note which of these exist in `FEATURE_DIR` (for use in later steps):
- `tasks.md` — archival and task counting
- `research.md` — knowledge capture, known issues & gotchas
- `data-model.md` — entity merging
- `contracts/` — API documentation (non-empty directory)
- `checklists/` — quality tracking
- `quickstart.md` — integration scenarios

### 0.4 Validate or Bootstrap Memory Directory

Check if `MEMORY_DIR` exists:

**If `MEMORY_DIR` exists**: Read its contents. Note which files are present (`constitution.md`, `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `changelog.md`).

**If `MEMORY_DIR` does not exist**: Create it:
```
mkdir -p MEMORY_DIR
```

**If `MEMORY_DIR/spec.md` does not exist** (first archival):
- If `TEMPLATES_DIR/spec-template.md` exists, copy it as the seed and populate from the feature spec
- Otherwise, create `spec.md` with the feature's spec content as the initial main spec
- Note in the report: "Bootstrapped `.specify/memory/spec.md` from first feature"

**If `MEMORY_DIR/plan.md` does not exist** (first archival):
- If `TEMPLATES_DIR/plan-template.md` exists, copy it as the seed and populate from the feature plan
- Otherwise, create `plan.md` with the feature's plan content as the initial main plan
- Note in the report: "Bootstrapped `.specify/memory/plan.md` from first feature"

### 0.5 Load Constitution (Guardrails)

Read `MEMORY_DIR/constitution.md` if it exists. Extract:
- Core Principles (numbered roman numerals or named sections)
- Architecture Standards
- Quality Gates

**Constitution is non-negotiable.** Any feature content that conflicts with a constitution MUST principle is flagged as CRITICAL and must be resolved before merging. Do not silently override or reinterpret constitution rules.

### 0.6 Check Extension Hooks (before archival)

Check if `REPO_ROOT/.specify/extensions.yml` exists:
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under `hooks.before_archive`
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently
- Filter to only hooks where `enabled: true`
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook
- For each executable hook, output based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks
    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}` — {description}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks
    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: /{command}
    Wait for the result before proceeding.
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or the file does not exist, skip silently

---

## Step 1: Feature Analysis

Read the feature specification and extract:

**From spec.md:**
- User Stories / Integration Scenarios (with priorities and acceptance criteria)
- Functional Requirements (detect the project's ID convention — e.g., FR-XXX, REQ-XXX, or unnumbered)
- Non-Functional Requirements (if any)
- Key Entities and their fields
- Edge cases and error handling
- Success Criteria

**From plan.md:**
- New dependencies introduced (with versions)
- New modules/services created
- Architecture changes (project structure, routing)
- Configuration changes (env vars, properties)
- Branch name (from metadata)

**From data-model.md (if exists):**
- New models and their definitions
- Relationships between entities
- Validation rules

**From research.md (if exists):**
- Key technical decisions and trade-offs
- External API integrations
- Known issues and gotchas (for agent file merging)

**From tasks.md (if exists):**
- Count completed tasks: lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
- Count total tasks: lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`

---

## Step 2: Conflict Detection & Gap Analysis

Before merging, systematically check for issues.

### 2.1 Constitution Compliance (CRITICAL)

For each extracted requirement, user story, and architecture decision, verify it does not conflict with any constitution MUST principle or Architecture Standard.

**If a constitution conflict exists**, flag it as CRITICAL:
```
🔴 CONSTITUTION CONFLICT:
- Feature FR-XXX: "[requirement]" conflicts with Principle [N]: "[principle text]"
  → This MUST be resolved before archival can proceed.
```

### 2.2 Conflicts

1. **Requirement ID Collisions:** If the feature has an ID that already exists in main spec, flag it.
2. **Entity Redefinitions:** If an entity is being modified (not just added), highlight the delta.
3. **Dependency Conflicts:** If a new dependency version conflicts with existing ones, note it.

### 2.3 Gaps

Categorize discrepancies between the feature spec and main memory:

| Category | What to look for |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Requirements** | Missing IDs, unmatched acceptance criteria |
| **Architecture** | Undocumented modules, missing routing/wiring |
| **Integration** | New contracts not reflected in main plan |
| **Data Model** | Entity changes without migration notes |
| **Testing** | New components without test strategy |

**If conflicts or significant gaps exist**, list them:
```
⚠️ ISSUES DETECTED:
- FR-005: Main says "X", Feature says "Y" → Recommend: [resolution]
- Entity `User`: Added field `role` → Verify backward compatibility
- Gap: New `/api/settings` route not in main plan routing section
```

---

## Step 3: Clarify (exactly once; max 5 questions)

If conflicts or gaps require human judgment, ask **only questions that materially change scope or correctness**. Skip this step entirely if everything is unambiguous.

**Always ask** if any CRITICAL constitution conflicts were detected — these cannot be auto-resolved.

Use this format and **wait for answers**:

```markdown
## Question [N]: [Topic]
**Context**: [Quote the relevant spec/plan/constitution section]
**Decision Needed**: [1 sentence]
**Suggested Answers**:
| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A | [Option A] | [Impact] |
| B | [Option B] | [Impact] |
| C | [Option C] | [Impact] |
| Custom | Provide your own | [How it affects scope] |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
```

**Rules:**
- Max 5 questions total.
- Max 3 unresolved `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` markers in output — beyond that, make reasonable defaults and note them in the report.
- If no questions are needed, proceed directly to Step 4.

---

## Step 4: Impact Mapping

Before making any edits, produce a brief impact map:

```markdown
### Impact Map
| Artifact | Sections Affected | Change Type |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| `.specify/memory/spec.md` | User Stories, FR-012–FR-015, Entities | Append + Update |
| `.specify/memory/plan.md` | Dependencies, Project Structure | Append |
| `.specify/memory/changelog.md` | Merged Features Log | New entry |
| `GEMINI.md` | Recent Changes, Known Issues | Append |
```

This gives the user a preview before edits are applied.

---

## Step 5: Archival (Apply Edits)

### Edit Rules
- Use absolute paths for all file references.
- Preserve existing document structure and ordering.
- Prefer appending over restructuring.
- Add a `[Source: specs/###-feature-name]` traceability tag to merged content.
- Add a **Revision note** (date + reason) to each modified artifact.
- Respect scoping hints — skip artifacts not in scope and explicitly note them.
- **Detect and follow the project's existing ID convention** (FR-XXX, REQ-XXX, Flow1, US-XX, etc.). Continue the sequence from the highest existing ID in main memory. Never reuse or renumber existing IDs.
- **Constitution constraints must be respected** — do not merge content that violates them.

### 5.1 Update Main Specification (`.specify/memory/spec.md`)

1. **Add User Stories / Integration Scenarios** — maintain priority ordering.
2. **Merge Functional Requirements** — continue from the highest existing ID. Group by domain/module if the spec is large.
3. **Update Key Entities** — add new entities; update existing ones if fields were added.
4. **Update Edge Cases and Error Handling.**
5. **Update Data Flow / Architecture** if the feature changed system data flows.
6. **Merge Success Criteria** if present.
7. **Deduplicate** — ensure no duplicate requirements in the final output.

### 5.2 Update Main Plan (`.specify/memory/plan.md`)

1. **Dependencies:** Add new packages (with versions) to "Primary Dependencies" or equivalent section.
2. **Project Structure:** Add new modules/services to the structure tree.
3. **Configuration:** Note new environment variables or config additions.
4. **Routing & Navigation:** Add new routes, endpoints, or wiring.
5. **Testing Strategy:** Add test coverage notes for new components.
6. **Remove from "Future Work"** anything that was just implemented.
7. Ensure plan reflects the *implemented* state.

### 5.3 Update Agent Knowledge File (GEMINI.md / AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md)

1. Find the project's agent knowledge file (check, in order: `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` in REPO_ROOT).
2. If found, follow the agent-file-template structure and update these sections:

   **"Active Technologies"** — add any new languages/frameworks/versions from the feature plan.

   **"Project Structure"** — update if modules were added.

   **"Commands"** — add new build/run commands if the tech stack changed.

   **"Recent Changes"** — prepend a new entry:
   ```markdown
   - ###-feature-name: [Brief description of what was added]
   ```

   **"Known Issues & Gotchas"** — if `research.md` exists in the feature, extract any gotchas/issues and merge them using the standard format:
   ```markdown
   ### ⚠️ [Issue Title]
   **Issue:** [What went wrong]
   **Root Cause:** [Why it happened]
   **Prevention Rule:** [Actionable rule]
   ```
   Deduplicate against existing entries.

3. If no agent file exists, skip this step and note it in the report.

### 5.4 Archive to Changelog

Create or update `.specify/memory/changelog.md`:

```markdown
## Merged Features Log

### [FEATURE NAME] — YYYY-MM-DD
**Branch:** [branch-name from plan.md]
**Spec:** specs/###-feature-name

**What was added:**
- [Summary of user stories/scenarios implemented]

**New Components:**
- [Modules/services added]

**Tasks Completed:** [completed]/[total] tasks
```

Count tasks using the checkbox format: `- [X]` or `- [x]` = completed; `- [ ]` = incomplete. If `tasks.md` does not exist, omit the "Tasks Completed" line.

### 5.5 Update Feature Spec Status

In the feature's `spec.md` and `plan.md` files (inside `FEATURE_DIR`, **not** in memory), check for a `**Status**:` metadata field in the document header (typically in the first 10 lines, e.g., `**Status**: Draft`).

If found and the value is `Draft`, update it to `Completed`:
- `**Status**: Draft` → `**Status**: Completed`

This marks the feature specification as finalized after merge. Do not change other status values (e.g., `In Progress`, `Blocked`) — only `Draft` → `Completed`.

---

## Step 6: Archival Report

Output the following structured report. Use **absolute paths** for all file references.

```markdown
# Archival Report

## Changed Files
| File (absolute path) | Change Summary |
|----------------------|----------------|
| `/absolute/path/to/spec.md` | Added [IDs], [N] user stories, [N] entities |
| `/absolute/path/to/plan.md` | Updated dependencies, project structure |
| `/absolute/path/to/changelog.md` | New entry for [feature name] |
| `/absolute/path/to/GEMINI.md` | Recent Changes, Known Issues |

## Feature Status
[List spec/plan files whose status was updated from Draft to Completed, or "No status fields found"]

## Bootstrapped
[List any files that were created for the first time, or "None"]

## Constitution Compliance
[Confirm all merged content respects constitution constraints, or list any unresolved CRITICAL conflicts]

## Edits Applied
[Brief summary of each artifact update]

## Conflicts Resolved
[List any conflicts that were resolved and how, or "None"]

## Outstanding Items
[Any remaining `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` markers, or "None"]

## Defaults Applied
[Any decisions made with reasonable defaults instead of asking, or "None"]

## Scoping
[Which artifacts were updated, and which were skipped due to scope modifiers]
```

**Important:** Do NOT delete the input feature spec files.

---

## Step 7: Post-Archival Hooks & Recommendations

### 7.1 Check Extension Hooks (after archival)

Check if `REPO_ROOT/.specify/extensions.yml` exists:
- Look for entries under `hooks.after_archive`
- Apply the same filtering and output logic as Step 0.6
- If no hooks are registered or the file does not exist, skip silently

### 7.2 Recommendations

Provide actionable next steps:

1. **Manual Review Items:** Anything flagged during conflict detection or constitution compliance check.
2. **Cleanup Suggestions:**
   - Can the feature spec folder be archived? (e.g., `mv specs/###-feature-name .specify/archive/`)
   - Are there orphaned files to remove?
3. **Verification:**
   - Run `make test` (or the project's equivalent) to verify nothing broke.
   - Review the archival report for accuracy.
4. **Follow-up:**
   - Update `README.md` if CLI commands or user-facing APIs changed.
   - Capture architectural insights from `research.md` into project memory if applicable.

---

## Done Criteria

- All non-conflicting feature content merged into main memory artifacts.
- Constitution compliance verified for all merged content.
- Memory directory bootstrapped if this was the first archival.
- Feature spec `**Status**: Draft` updated to `Completed` (if applicable).
- Conflicts either resolved (with user input) or marked with `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` (max 3).
- Archival Report printed with absolute paths for all changed files, constitution status, and next steps.
- Scoping hints respected — skipped artifacts explicitly noted.
