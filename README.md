What Lean Storytelling is:

* Technique to tell stories easily, using common good practices, to be understood by your audience

More:

* It is a basic set of recipes to help shape a story
* It is quite easy to read and understand, but difficult to master
* Fit for a products and features development, not to be a succesful Hollywood screenwriter or awarded novelist
* Usable from early stage to delivery: empathy, problem discovery, ideation, specs, development, test, deployment, communication, sales, advertising, explainer videos, documentation
* Keep everyone in sync and aligned across different teams, remove some of the natural friction
* People will understand the "why", the goal, the guiding light
* Inspired by Lean Canvas, Monomyth, and The Golden Circle
* Roots in Agile, Lean Startup, Design Thinking, UX research
* Very simple and humble, voluntarily limited by design, using the systemic approach

# Overview of the playbook

* Tell a story, using the base ingredients.
* If you want/need to detail, use the options.
* Try, learn, get feedback, remix, change, and adapt to your audience, always & continuously!
* If you reduce your story to the bare minimum, just a few words, you might land on your Unique Value Proposition (UVP).
* If you want to seriously learn strong story telling techniques, read the right litterature.
* This story telling technique differentiates: it is lean and agile, not generic, more dedicated to businesses

It can be used to:
