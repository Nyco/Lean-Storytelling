**What is "TopSol Playbook"?**

"TopSol Playbook" is a set of recipes, templates and good practices, te help you shape your story telling, aimed at product people, like product owners, scrum masters, agile coaches, marketing people, sales people, even founders and C-levels CxO.

**Story telling, you say? What else?**

The "TopSol Playbook" may help you tell stories, but also may help you shape your {unique|key} value proposition.

**How is it used? From A to Z?**

It can be used to:
* describe a User Story or Epic, within an Agile team, using Scrum or Kanban
* test a solution, or a {unique|key} value proposition, validate or invalidate, persist or pivot, useful for Lean Startup and Design Thinking approaches
* sell a solution, product, or feature

**What does "TopSol Playbook" stand for?**

* **Playbook**, because I didn't want another "framework" ;-)
* **TopSol**, because To-P-Sol:
  * **To**: Target, the people and personas you are targetting with your product or service
  * **P**: Problem, the problem that you have validated they face and suffer from, that is worth fixing
  * **Sol**: Solution, the solution that you bring to your targets, 

**Where does it come from?**

Standing on shoulders of giants who stand on shoulders of giants: "TopSol Playbook" has its roots in the Lean Canvas approach by Ash Maurya, and gets inspirations from many other sources.

I highly recommend this free online course: https://www.udemy.com/lean-canvas-course/ by Ash Maurya.
