What Lean Storytelling is:

* Technique to tell stories easily, using best practices, in order to be understood by your audience

More:

* It is a basic set of recipes to help shape a story
* It is quite easy to read and understand, but difficult to master: practice a lot
* Fit for a businesses, products and features development (NOT to be a succesful Hollywood screenwriter or awarded novelist)
* Usable from early stage to delivery phases: empathy, problem discovery, ideation, specs, development, test, deployment, communication, sales, advertising, explainer videos, documentation
* Keep everyone in sync and aligned across different teams, remove some of the natural friction and misunderstading
* People will understand the "why", the goal, the guiding light, the north star of you story
* Inspired by Lean Canvas, Monomyth, and The Golden Circle
* Roots in Agile, Lean Startup, Design Thinking, UX research, entrepreneurship
* Very simple and humble, voluntarily minimalistic by design, using the systemic approach

# Overview of the playbook

* Tell a story, using the base ingredients
* If you want/need to detail, use the options
* Try, learn, get feedback, remix, change, and adapt to your audience, always & continuously
* If you reduce your story to the bare minimum, just a few words, you might land on your Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
* If you want to seriously learn strong story telling techniques, read the right litterature
* This story telling technique differentiates: it is lean and agile, not generic, more dedicated to businesses

## Basic story

These are the three building blocks, the foundations of a good story:

* **Target**: the user or the buyer, the hero of the journey/adventure, the one who will unergo the biggest changes
* **Problem**: the target's problem or antagonism
* **Solution**: your solution, but don't say too much about it

## Detailed story

Add the necessary details, to re-inforce the story:

* Target
    * **Empathy**: what the target sees, feels, hears, says 
* Problem
    * **Consequences**: the impact of the problem on the target's daily life
* Solution
    * **Benefits**: the benefits that your solution offers

## Full story

Add a contextual start, and an inspirationnal end:

* **Context**: in what landscape the target evolves
* Target
    * Empathy
* Problem
    * Consequences
* Solution
    * Benefits
* **Why**: the main motivator behind the story

## Extension pack

Add any item, wherever you feel:
* Challenge of the audience, a open question
* Quote, in order to validate the pain point or the benefits
* Alternatives, unsatisfying solutions to the hero's problem
* Competition to the solution, but yours is better
* Unfair advantage of your solution
* Warnings
* Self-benefits on your business/product
* Stages in AARRR
* Call To Action
* A failure, a failed attempt before the solution is found

## Summary

In a simple tables, this gives:

| Core items | Detail items | Complete story |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| | | **Context**: where and when, the surroundings of the hero| | 
| **Target**, the hero, who it is about |
|  | **Empathy**, what the hero sees and feels |
| **Problem** the hero faces, that slows down (NOT the absence of YOUR solution) | |
| | **Consequences** of the problem  |
| **Solution**, what you offer, and how |  |
| | **Benefits**, the advantages your solution delivers  |
| | | **Why**, he guiding light, your internal compass | |
