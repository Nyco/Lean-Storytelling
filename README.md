# Overview of the playbook

Tell a story, using the base ingredients.

If you want/need to detail, use the options.

Try, learn, get feedback, remix, change, and adapt to your audience, always!

If you reduce your story to the bare minimum, you can land on your Unique Value Proposition (UVP).

If you want to seriously learn story telling techniques, read the right litterature.
