# spec-kit-learn

A [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) extension that generates educational guides from AI-assisted implementations and enhances spec clarifications with mentoring context — designed to help early-career engineers build senior-level engineering judgment.

## What it does

This extension adds two commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/speckit.learn.review` | Generates a `learn.md` guide explaining the technical decisions, patterns, and concepts applied during implementation |
| `/speckit.learn.clarify` | Enhanced `/speckit.clarify` that includes "Why this matters" context, pros/cons analysis, and recommended options for each clarification |

### `/speckit.learn.review` — Learn from what was built

After running `/speckit.implement`, this command analyzes the completed work and produces a concise `learn.md` that covers:

- **Key Decisions** — what was chosen, why, what alternatives existed, and when you'd choose differently
- **Concepts to Know** — design patterns, framework conventions, and data patterns used in the implementation
- **Architecture Overview** — how the feature's code is organized and why
- **Glossary** — domain-specific or framework-specific terms worth knowing

The guide is written in a mentoring tone — direct, practical, and focused on building transferable judgment rather than narrating code.

### `/speckit.learn.clarify` — Clarify with context

A drop-in enhancement for `/speckit.clarify` that adds:

- **"Why this matters"** block before each question — explains the risk of leaving it unresolved and what downstream decision it unlocks
- **Pros/Cons table** for multiple-choice options — quick signal on tradeoffs
- **Recommended option** with reasoning — so you learn what an experienced engineer would pick and why
- **Mentoring tone** throughout — connects each explanation to real consequences

## Requirements

- [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) >= 0.1.0

No external MCP servers or tools are required — this extension works entirely with Spec Kit's core artifacts.

## Installation

### From the community catalog

```bash
specify extension add learn
```

Or install from the repository directly:

```bash
specify extension add learn --from https://github.com/imviancagrace/spec-kit-learn/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip
```

### From a local clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imviancagrace/spec-kit-learn.git
cd /path/to/your-speckit-project
specify extension add --dev /path/to/spec-kit-learn
```

After installation, verify:

```bash
specify extension list

# Should show:
#  ✓ Learning Extension (v1.0.0)
#     Generate educational guides from implementations and enhance clarifications with mentoring context
#     Commands: 2 | Hooks: 1 | Status: Enabled
```

## Usage

### Generating a learning guide

After completing implementation, run:

```
/speckit.learn.review
```

Optionally scope to a specific phase, ticket, or topic:

```
/speckit.learn.review Phase 3
/speckit.learn.review PROJ-456
/speckit.learn.review state management
```

This will:
- Load all spec artifacts (spec, plan, tasks, research, data model, contracts)
- Analyze completed tasks and referenced source files
- Prioritize content by educational value
- Write `learn.md` to your feature directory

### Clarifying with learning context

Before planning, run:

```
/speckit.learn.clarify
```

This works like `/speckit.clarify` but each question includes:
- Why the clarification matters (risk and downstream impact)
- A recommended answer with reasoning
- Pros/cons for each option

### Hook: after_implement

When enabled, the extension prompts you to generate a learning guide automatically after `/speckit.implement` completes.

## Artifacts

### learn.md

Created by `/speckit.learn.review` in your feature directory. Structured as:

```markdown
# What I Learned: [Feature Name]

**Feature**: Browse filing guides by state
**Generated**: 2026-03-03
**Scope**: Full feature
**Implementation status**: 18/18 tasks completed
